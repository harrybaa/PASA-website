This is the official website of the PASA lab.

If you want to modify the home and other pages, please read the instructor clearly.

1. HOME PAGE
Home page is made by HTML purely. Things presented go after index-main div. I have note every part of the page in the code. Please use HTML code in this page. Ex: if you want to add some text to the introduction. Paste the text included by <p> tags to the intro-wrapper div.
After you finish the code, commit to the github. Then ask me to check and upload online.

2. OTHER PAGES
All other pages are made by HTML templates. If you want to edit the text, you have to get the access of the WordPress. And edit the content in PAGES tab like plain text in every editor.
